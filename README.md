This is an AI project I completed with my classmates on Artificial Intelligence Concepts. 

We discuss the impacts of the the algorithms Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithm, and Hill Climbing on the prisoner's dilemma in game theory.

We also use machine learning techniques to analyse the results.
